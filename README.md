Explore the world and plan your next vacation with Travel Guru! Travel Guru is a convenient application that allows you to view areas of interest in any place in the world. It uses the Google Maps API and the Travel Advisor API to do so. While viewing areas of interest in a certain area, you are able to filter by restaurants, hotels, attractions, and ratings. You can, for example, view all 5 star restaurants in your chosen area. If you're not satisfied with the information displayed on the map, there is a card panel list that displays more details about each area of interest displayed on the map. You can view an area of interest's website, awards, price, and more. To make navigating easier, clicking on an area of interest on the map will cause the card panel list to scroll to the corresponding card panel. Please enjoy!
